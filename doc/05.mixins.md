Mixins
-------------------

Gridle offer a bunch of usefull SASS mixins to apply grid specific CSS to your custom html tags. All the classes described in the Classes section can be replaced by mixins of this section.


### Grid

These are the base mixins of the grid system. The root mixin is the **@include gridle_container();** one and has to be applied on the element that contains all the **@include gridle(1);**, **@include gridle(2);**, **@include gridle(3);**, etc... mixins.

```fn
@include gridle_container (); 
@include gridle ( {column-number} , {state} );

with context :

@include gridle ( {column-number} , {context} ); 
@include gridle ( {column-number} , {context} , {state} );

gridle_set :

@include gridle_set((
	grid : {columns-number}
), {state} );

@include gridle_set((
	container : true
), {state} );
```

```scss
.wrapper {
	@include gridle_container ( ); // I'm the container
	max-width : 960px;
	margin : 0 auto;
}
#header {
	@include gridle ( 12 );
}
#content {
	@include gridle ( 8 ); // I made 8 columns width...
	@include gridle ( 12 , mobile tablet ); // ... but 12 columns width on mobile and tablet
}
#sidebar {
	@include gridle ( 4 ); // I made 4 columns width...
	@include gridle ( 12 , "mobile" ); // ... but 12 columns width on "mobile"
}
#footer {
	@include gridle ( 12 );
}
```


### Grid Parent (nested grids)

This mixin has to be applied on a grid-x element that will contain a nested grid.

```fn
@include gridle_parent ( ); 
@include gridle_parent ( {state} );

gridle_set :

@include gridle_set((
	parent : true
), {state} );
```

```scss
#content {
	@include gridle ( 8 );
	@include gridle ( 12 , "mobile" );
	@include gridle_parent ( ); // I'm the parent of a nested grid system

	.column {
		@include gridle ( 4 );
		@include gridle ( 12 , 'mobile' );
	}
}
```


### Clear each **NEW**

This mixin will make all the {x}n+1 direct child clear itself automatically.

```fn
@include gridle_clear_each ( {each} , {what} );
@include gridle_clear_each ( {each} , {what} , {state} );

gridle_set :

@include gridle_set((
	clear_each : ( {each} , {what} )
), {state} );
```

```scss
#myContentThatHasWeirdHeightChilds {
	@include gridle_parent( );
	@include gridle_clear_each( 2, left );
}
```


### Centered Grid

This mixin **has to be applied on a grid-x** element and will center the column.

```fn
@include gridle_centered ( ); 
@include gridle_centered ( {state} );

gridle_set :

@include gridle_set((
	centered : true
), {state} );
```

```scss
#content {
	@include gridle ( 8 );
	@include gridle ( 12 , "mobile" );
	@include gridle_centered ( ); // this will make the column centered for all sizes
}
```


### Vertical Aligned Grid Items **BETA**

Gridle allows you to align vertically your grid elements based on his neighbours in the same line. This has to be used with caution and you must test if it fit your particular need.

```fn
@include gridle_vertical_align( );
@include gridle_vertical_align( {align} );
@include gridle_vertical_align( {align} , {state} );

gridle_set :

@include gridle_set((
	vertical_align : {align}
), {state} );
```

```scss
#myContainerThatHaveGridItemsAsDirectChild {
	@include gridle_vertical_align( );
}
```

This mixin apply a **font-size of 0** on the parent itself and a **font-size of 1rem** on the direct childs. This is to avoid the display:inline-block space thing... You have to set your font on the html tag for this to work fine...

> When using this, the direction parameter will not have any effect anymore...
> This mixin have to be applied on a parent/container element that has direct grid- childs


### Push & Pull

The push and pull mixins are used to offset the grid elements or event swap 2 of them for SEO purpose. The html structure will not be touched as well 

```fn
@include gridle_push ( {column-number} , {state} ); 
@include gridle_pull ( {column-number} , {state} );

gridle_set :

@include gridle_set((
	push : {column-number},
	pull : {column-number}
), {state} );
```

```scss
/**
 * This code will visualy swap the 2 columns "content" and "sidebar"
 * The HTML structure is not changed as well
 */
#header {
	@include gridle ( 12 );
}
#content {
	@include gridle ( 8 );
	@include gridle_push ( 4 ); // I will be offset by 4 columns on the right
}
#sidebar {
	@include gridle ( 4 );
	@include gridle_pull ( 8 ); // I will be effset 8 columns on the left

}
#footer {
	@include gridle ( 12 );
}
```


### Prefix & Suffix

The prefix and suffix classes are used to create dead spaces before or after a grid element. 

```fn
@include gridle_prefix ( {column-number} , {state} ); 
@include gridle_suffix ( {column-number} , {state} );

gridle_set :

@include gridle_set((
	prefix : {column-number},
	suffix : {column-number}
), {state} );
```

```scss
/**
 * This code will generate an "checkerboard" style grid
 */
#box1 {
	@include gridle ( 3 );
	@include gridle_prefix ( 3 ); // 3 columns of dead space to the right
}
#box2 {
	@include gridle ( 3 );
	@include gridle_prefix ( 3 ); // 3 columns of dead space to the right
}
#box3 {
	@include gridle ( 3 );
	@include gridle_suffix ( 3 ); // 3 columns of dead space to the left
}
#box4 {
	@include gridle ( 3 );
	@include gridle_suffix ( 3 ); // 3 columns of dead space to the left
}
```


### Hide, show, etc...

These mixins are used to hide, show or set visibility to some elements for certain states (cf. States) 

```fn
@include gridle_hide ( {state} ); 
@include gridle_show ( {state} ); 
@include gridle_show_inline ( {state} ); 
@include gridle_not_visible ( {state} ); 
@include gridle_visible ( {state} );

gridle_set :

@include gridle_set((
	hide : true | false,
	show : true | false,
	show_inline : true | false,
	not_visible : true | false,
	visible : true | false
), {state} );
```

```scss
#header {
	@include gridle ( 12 );
}
#content {
	@include gridle ( 8 );
}
#sidebar {
	@include gridle ( 4 );
	@include gridle_hide ( "mobile" ); // Not enough space on mobile so we hide it
}
#footer {
	@include gridle ( 12 );
}
```


### State (**VERY USEFULL**)

This mixin is really, really, really... I mean REALLY useful. It allows you to write some specific CSS on an element for certain states (cf.  States). You can also specify min-width and/or max-width as parameters.

```fn
@include gridle_state ( {state} ) { 
         {custom-css} 
} 
@include gridle_state ( {min-width} , {max-width} ) { 
         {custom-css} 
}
```

```scss
#header {
	@include gridle ( 12 );
}
#content {
	@include gridle ( 8 );
}
#sidebar {
	@include gridle ( 4 );

	/* We change the background to yellow and we	
	 * add a pink border to the sidebar only on tablet...
	 * ... JUST BECAUSE I CAN!
	 */
	@include gridle_state ( tablet ) {
		background : yellow;
		border : 1px solid pink;
	}

	/**
	 * You can specify multiple states directly width gridle_state :
	 * !!! multiple states names are the 1st parameter, so NO comma between them...
	 * The states can be within quotes or not...
	 */
	@include gridle_state ( mobile "tablet" ) {
		// ... your custom css here
	}

	/**
	 * Even make a custom query
	 * When passing a custom map state object, it will be extended with the default
	 * settings that you have in your gridle_setup
	 * !!! query and (max-width, min-width) cannot be used together...
	 */
	@include gridle_state ( (
		query : 'only print'
		// or maybe a max-width : 900px
	) ) {
		background : red;
	}

}
#footer {
	@include gridle ( 12 );
}
```

> **Do not include all the others grid mixins into the gridle_state one.** This is because SASS does not handle nested media queries correctly – instead, always use the {state} parameter of the gridle(), gridle_push(), etc... mixins and everything will work just as expected.


### Set multiple mixins at once **NEW**

Sometime you want to apply more than one mixin on your item. This can be a pain to write multiple times @include gridle_... You have now this mixin to help you with this.

```fn
@include gridle_set( {settings} , {state} );
```

```scss
#myCoolSidebar {

	/**
	 * Default usage :
	 */
	// set the default values
	@include gridle_set( (
		grid : 4,
		push : 8
	) );

	// erase values for tablet
	@include gridle_set( (
		grid : 12,
		push : 0
	), tablet );
	// you can also pass ( tablet, mobile ) as {state} param to apply to multiple states at once

	// hide on mobile :
	@include gridle_hide( mobile );

	/**
	 * ------------------ OR --------------------
	 */

	/**
	 * Or pass your states directly in one gridle_set call :
	 * !!! do not set any state as second parameter with this solution
	 * Be careful to not have any states that match a reserved gridle setting name like push, pull, etc...
	 */
	@include gridle_set( (
		grid : 4,
		push : 8,
		tablet : (
			grid : 12,
			push : 0
		)
	) );
}
```


### Generate Classes

This mixin is used to generate all the needed classes for your grid system. This mixin is quite modular and allows you to generate all the classes, or if you need, only the classes of a particular state, or only the push and pull classes, etc...

```fn
@include gridle_generate_classes ( ); 
@include gridle_generate_classes ( {stateName} );
@include gridle_generate_classes ( {stateName} , {what} );
@include gridle_generate_classes ( {stateName} , {what} , {scope} );
```

```scss
/**
* Setting up your grid :
*/
@include gridle_setup( (
	context : 12,
	gutter-width : 20px
) );

/**
* Register your states if needed :
*/
@include gridle_register_state ( mobile , (
	max-width : 500px
) );

/**
* Generate all the classes :
*/
@include gridle_generate_classes ( );

/**
 * Generate only the classes of the state mobile
 */
@include gridle_generate_classes( mobile );

/**
 * Generate only the push and pull classes of the default state
 * Note that the what parameter is a list
 */
@include gridle_generate_classes( default, ( push, pull ) );

/**
 * Generate the push, pull, grid and visible classes for all states in a specific order
 */
@include gridle_generate_classes( null, ( visible, pull, grid, push ) );
```

> If you generate classes for a large grid with multiple states and a lot of columns, I encourage you to make a separated SASS file that contains the grid system only. This will prevent all the classes to be calculated each time you save your working file.

> The "what" parameter define also the order in witdh the classes will be generated

#### The what parameter

The parameter {what} can be very useful. It allows you to specify witch classes you want to generate. Here's a list of available values that you can use :

```scss
// packages :
default 		: all the default classes listed bellow
helpers 	: all the helpers classes listed bellow

// default :
grid 		: all the grid- classes
push 		: all the push- classes
pull 		: all the pull-classes
prefix 		: all the prefix- classes
suffix 		: all the suffix- classes

// helpers :
float 		: all the float- classes
clear 		: all the clear- classes
gutter 		: all the gutter- classes
no_gutter 	: all the no-gutter- classes
margin 	: alias for gutter
no_margin 	: alias for no_gutter
centered 	: all the centered- classes
parent 		: all the parent- classes
vertical_align 	: all the vertical-align- classes
hide 		: all the hide- classes
show 		: all the show- classes (+ show-inline-)
not_visible 	: all the not-visible- classes
visible 		: all the visible- classes
clear_each 	: all the clear-each- classes
```


### Float

This mixin is used to make element float left, right or both, like a normal float does, but with state capabilities.

```fn
@include gridle_float( {left | right | both}, {state} );

@include gridle_set((
	float : {left | right | both}
), {state} );
```

```scss
#sidebar {
	@include gridle_float ( right ); // float right normally...
	@include gridle_float ( left, 'mobile' ); // ... but left on mobile
}
```


### Clear

This mixin work exactly like the float one, but to clear floats... Pretty simple no?

```fn
@include gridle_clear( {left | right | both}, {state} );

@include gridle_set((
	clear : {left | right | both}
), {state} );
```

```markup
#sidebar {
	@include gridle_clear( right ); // clear right normally...
	@include gridle_clear( left, 'mobile' ); // ... but left on mobile
}
```


### Gutters

These mixins are available to manage gutter on grid elements.
In gridle, the gutters are actually paddings.

```fn
@include gridle_gutter( {sides}, {state} ); 
@include gridle_no_gutter( {sides}, {state} );

@include gridle_set((
	gutter : {sides},
	margin : {sides},
	no_gutter : {sides},
	no_margin : {sides}
), {state} );
```

```scss
#sidebar {
	@include gridle_gutter(); // add padding to left and right of $gridle-gutter-width value

	/**
	 * You can specify a list of side as first param :
	 * top left right bottom    are supported
	 */
	@include gridle_gutter ( top left ); // add gutter to top and left only
}
#content {
	@include gridle_no_gutter(); // remove padding to left and right

	@include gridle_no_gutter ( top left ); // remove gutter to top and left only
}
```

> Secret : The mixins **"gridle_margin"** and **"gridle_no_margin"** work too...


### What is the context ?

The context is **the number of columns in your grid used to calculate the widths**. By default, if not specified in the mixins that support the context, it will be equal as the $gridle-columns-count configuration.

For example, if your configuration is set to **$gridle-columns-count : 12;** and that you do **@include gridle( 6 );**, this will set your width to **100% / 12 * 6 = 50%**

If you set the context like so **@include gridle( 6 , 10 );**, even if your configuration is **$gridle-columns-count : 12;** , the width will be set to **100% / 10 * 6 = 60%**
