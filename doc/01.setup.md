Setup
------------------

Gridle, in order to work, **need to be set up by using the gridle_setup mixin**. In this mixin, you can pass different configurations variables like the context, the gutter-width, etc...


```fn
@include gridle_setup( {settings} );
```

```scss
$settings : (
	context : 12, 			// number of columns in your grid
	gutter-width : 20px,		// size of the gutters
	direction : ltr, 			// direction
	name-multiplicator : 1 	// to generate like grid-5, grid-10, etc...
	// and more... (see in advanced settings section)
);
@include gridle_setup($settings);
```

> Your states does not have the same name as a gridle option like gutter-width...
